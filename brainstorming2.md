### App Idea 1: WordPlay
What: WordPlay is an recreational app aimed to help users expand and practice their creativity in a logic based word game. 

Who: The app is targeted at individuals interested in expanding their problem solving and memorization skills. 

Why: We are building this app to expand upon already existing apps such as Wordle to provide greater personalization and additional features.  

Challenges: Potential challenges include setting up a database such as user playing streaks and high scores. Additionally, since this will be a recreational app, it will be tricky to design a user fiendly intuitive layout as well. 

### App Idea 2: SafeWalk
What: Safewalk is a personal safety app that allows users to share their location with trusted contacts while walking alone, and sends alerts if they feel unsafe.

Who: Individuals, especially students, women, and people who often walk or commute alone at night or anytime.

Why: This app would be building upon already existing location sharing apps but centered around personal safety with added features specifically for encouraging safety.

Challenges: Ensuring data privacy and security, avoiding false alarms, and creating a user-friendly interface that is quick to access in emergencies.

### App Idea 3: Piece by Piece
What: This app allows users to put together puzzle pieces to form a picture of their choosing, encouraging them to exercise their minds and embrace their creativity.

Who: This app is designed for puzzle enthusiasts of all ages and skill sets.

Why: This app is created to provide a fun and engaging way for users to work on digital puzzles. It allows for a personalized experience by giving users control over the images and difficulty.

Challenges: Potential challenges include image handling and generation of puzzle pieces. Another challenge would be creating a smooth and responsive interface for dragging and snapping puzzle pieces into place.
